# Assignment 5 Solututions

## Question 1

```bash
path: /src/
```

1. This assignment creates a simple command line application.
2. We ask for user inputs for filling out a form. 
3. At any time, the user can re-edit the form fields.
4. This flow has been implemented with a stream from RxJS
5. The code has been split into MVU architecture.
6. One clear problem is immutability with regards to state, I will try to think on that and sort out an immutable implementation with regards to the form state if possible before assignment submission deadline.
7. To build and run the code, follow the commands below:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```
