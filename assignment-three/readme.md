# Assignment 3 Solututions

## Question 1

```bash
path: /QuestionOne/
```

1. As per the question, a discriminated union type of ProgressOption has been created.
2. It contains three states - NotStarted, Progress, Finished where Progress and Finished contain different types of values.
3. Custom constructors and helpers have been created which will aid with other functions developed.
4. Other functions developed include: match, fold, map, isEmpty, find and contains.
5. The implementation can be found by building and running the file. Please follow the commands below to do so.

```bash
tsc taskOne.ts
node taskOne.js
```

## Question 2

```bash
path: /QuestionTwo
```

1. This task has been written in Rust.
2. I have utilized the Option type in Rust along with its match and map functions.
3. The goal was to develop a short Command Line program that takes in user inputs and computes the result based on them.
4. I make use of Option since the user can input something incorrect or choose to input nothing.
5. Please follow the commands below to build and run the program and test it out!

```bash
rustc taskTwo.rs
./taskTwo
```
### Side Note:
* I had fun learning Rust with this assignment.
* Initially, I thought I would get to play with Rust but it was the other way around.
* However I got the hang of it after diving into the docs and bugging Lakin.
